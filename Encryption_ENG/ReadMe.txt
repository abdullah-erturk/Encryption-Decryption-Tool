### FEATURES:

All types of files are encrypted without file extension and size restrictions. 

Users can encrypt and decrypt their files with passwords they specify. 

The program performs a strong encryption process with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm.


### USAGE:

There are 2 types of usage methods for the program.

First method (installation):
Run the program, answer "yes" to the question about the installation of the program on the console screen.

The installation will be completed in a short time.

Now, when you right-click on any file in the Windows environment, you can use it with the "Encrypt File" option and for encrypted files, with the "Remove File Encryption" option.

Second method (drag-drop-encrypt/decrypt):
Drag and drop any file with any extension onto the encrypt.exe file, a console screen will open and ask you to specify a password.

To decrypt an encrypted file, drag and drop the .enc file onto the encrypt.exe file and enter the password you specified before.


### IMPORTANT NOTES:

If you forget the password, you cannot open your encrypted files again. Therefore, it is important to keep your password securely.

The program can encrypt all types of files without file extension and size restrictions. The encryption process of large files may take a long time. The encryption time for a 5 GB file is approximately 30 seconds. Of course, this time will vary depending on the hardware power of your computer.

The original extension of the encrypted files is protected during encryption. For example, when you encrypt the test.txt file, the new extension of the file will be test.txt.enc with the .enc extension.

The program is completely open source. You can download it from the repo, compile it with Visual Studio and use it by making the changes you want.
